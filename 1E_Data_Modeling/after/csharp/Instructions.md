# Lab 1E: Data Modeling in C#

**Time**: ~60 min
**Environment**: .NET 10 terminal

In this exercise you compare two data models for the same e-commerce domain — a **reference (normalized)** model that mirrors a relational schema, and an **embed (denormalized)** model designed around realistic common queries. The following steps look at partition-key choice with a hot-partition demo.

The lab uses a single project in the `1E_Data_Modeling` directory. Running `dotnet run` walks through each step, pausing for **Enter** between steps. Most steps are prebuilt — three have **student exercises** marked in the code (Steps 2, 4, and 6).

## Prerequisites

```bash
dotnet --version   # 10.x
```

This lab uses two Cosmos accounts:

| Steps  | Account                                                 | Endpoint env var               | Why                                                                                                       |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0–4    | [Serverless](https://github.com/manishmsfte/cosmos-workshop-deployment/blob/main/bicep/modules/cosmosdb.bicep)             | `COSMOS_ENDPOINT`              | Two new databases (`ModelingReference`, `ModelingEmbed`) hold the reference vs embed datasets.            |
| 5–7    | [Provisioned](https://github.com/manishmsfte/cosmos-workshop-deployment/blob/main/bicep/modules/cosmosdb.provisioned.bicep) | `COSMOS_ENDPOINT_PROVISIONED`  | Azure Monitor exposes per-partition RU consumption only for provisioned containers — needed for Step 7.   |

The new modeling databases on the serverless account are deployed in advance:

| Database           | Containers                                                                       | Partition key path |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `ModelingReference`| `Customers`, `Addresses`, `Products`, `ProductCategories`, `Orders`, `OrderItems` | `/partitionKey`    |
| `ModelingEmbed`    | `Customers`, `Products`, `Orders` (mixed `OrderDocument` + `ServiceInvoice`)     | `/partitionKey`    |

Every document in both modeling databases writes the same fixed value (`partitionKey = "default"`). The dataset is small enough to live in one logical partition — **partitioning isn't needed for scale and queries stay simple** (no cross-partition fan-out).

## Setup

1. Open a terminal in the `1E_Data_Modeling` directory:

   ```bash
   cd 1E_Data_Modeling
   ```

2. Verify both endpoint environment variables:

   ```powershell
   $env:COSMOS_ENDPOINT              # serverless — used by steps 0-4
   $env:COSMOS_ENDPOINT_PROVISIONED  # provisioned — used by steps 5-7
   ```

3. Run the lab:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Step 0: Seed the reference and embed databases (Prebuilt)

The seed data lives in `seed-reference.json` and `seed-embed.json` in this directory, each grouped into sections by container. The project copies them to its output folder at build time.

The seeded data describes three customers, five products in three categories, three orders and two service invoices. Identical logical data is shaped two ways: as relational rows in the reference DB, and as denormalized documents in the embed DB.

## Step 1: Fetch a complete order — reference model (Prebuilt)

To assemble one complete order in the reference model you walk references across six containers — `Orders → OrderItems → Products → ProductCategories`, plus `Customers` and `Addresses`.

In an equivalent relational database, you might use JOINs in a SQL query to achieve the same result with a normalized schema:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Orders o
JOIN OrderItems oi ON o.Id = oi.OrderId
JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerId = c.Id
JOIN Addresses a ON o.AddressId = a.Id
JOIN Products p ON oi.ProductId = p.Id
JOIN ProductCategories pc ON p.CategoryId = pc.Id
WHERE o.Id = 'order_001';
```

In Cosmos DB queries involve a single container, so every hop is its own round-trip and its own RU charge. This step prints each hop and tallies total RU and round-trip count.

**Expected behavior**: 7+ round-trips, RU charge sums across all of them.

## Step 2: Fetch a complete order — embed model (STUDENT EXERCISE)

In the embed model the customer name/address snapshot and all line items already live inside the order document, so a single point read returns everything. The contrast with Step 1's six-container walk is the whole point of the embed model — write it yourself to see how little code it takes.

In `Steps_Data_Modeling.cs` Step 2, replace the placeholder `resp` with a single `ReadItemAsync<OrderDocument>` call against the embed `Orders` container:

```csharp
var resp = await orders.ReadItemAsync<OrderDocument>(targetOrderId, Pk);
```

**Expected behavior**: 1 round-trip, ~1-3 RU. Compare directly to Step 1's totals.

**Tradeoff**: writes get bigger and customer data is duplicated across orders — Step 3 explores what that costs.

## Step 3: Update a customer address — model tradeoffs (Prebuilt)

Alice (cust_001) moves from `100 Main St, Seattle WA` to `555 New Lane, Bellevue WA`. The step performs the update in both models:

- **Reference model**: replace one `Addresses` document. Every order that joins on `addressId` resolves the new address on its next read. One write.
- **Embed model**: replace the `Customers` document — but past `OrderDocument`s still carry the **snapshotted old address** in `customerStreet / customerCity / ...`. Two valid answers:
  1. **Historical accuracy**: leave past orders as-is so each order reflects where it was actually shipped.
  2. **Propagate the change**: query affected orders and `ReplaceItem` each one. The step demonstrates this fan-out and reports the extra RU.

**The plumbing for option 2 in real systems is the Cosmos change feed**: subscribe to writes on `Customers`, look up affected orders, replace them. The lab does the same work inline with a query + replace so the cost is observable.

## Step 4: Designing by usage patterns — orders by customer name (STUDENT EXERCISE)

The embed schema was driven by the queries the app needs to be fast. The example used here - **orders by customer name** - should be a single-container query because every order doc carries a snapshot of `customerName`.

In `Steps_Data_Modeling.cs` Step 4, replace the placeholder query string with a parameterized query that returns the order docs (those with `docType = 'order'`) for the given customer name:

```csharp
var query = new QueryDefinition(
    "SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.docType = 'order' AND c.customerName = @name"
).WithParameter("@name", customerName);
```

**Expected output**: two orders for `Alice Anderson` printed with their dates and totals, plus the RU charged.

Other patterns this model is shaped for (try them in Data Explorer or extend Step 4):

| Pattern                       | How it's served                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Customer by id**           | Point read on `Customers/{id}`. Cheapest possible — typically ~1 RU.                                  |
| **Customer by name**         | `SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.name = @name` on `Customers`. Single PK so no fan-out.                       |
| **Order by id**              | Point read on `Orders/{id}`. The full order — customer snapshot + line items — comes back in one hop. |
| **Orders by customer name**  | The example the step runs. Snapshotted `customerName` keeps it single-container.                      |
| **Product list**             | `SELECT * FROM c` on `Products`. Tiny catalog, single PK, no `WHERE` clause needed.                   |
| **Revenue by date / month**  | `Orders` holds both `OrderDocument` and `ServiceInvoice` (discriminated by `docType`). A single `GROUP BY` on `c.date` rolls up product sales *and* service revenue — no `UNION`, no second container. |

**Takeaway**: design the model around the hot read paths. Embedding the customer snapshot keeps the orders-by-customer-name path cheap; co-locating invoices with orders keeps revenue rollups single-container. Both patterns trade write complexity for read simplicity.

## Step 5: Hot-partition seed (provisioned account) (Prebuilt)

The remaining three steps revisit partition-key choice on the **provisioned** account so you can view throughput metrics and scale settings in the Azure Portal. `OrdersHot` is keyed on `/orderDate` — a real-world anti-pattern where a system partitions by date and then every write "right now" lands on the same logical partition. Seed 100 orders, all with today's date, then run `SELECT DISTINCT VALUE c.orderDate FROM c` and observe **one** distinct partition-key value across the whole container.

## Step 6: Composite key — inspect and re-seed (STUDENT EXERCISE)

Read `OrdersComposite` and confirm it's keyed on `/partitionKey`. The lab uses a **synthetic composite key**: each document writes `customerId#orderDate` into `/partitionKey` to spread writes across ~50 logical partitions instead of one.

In `Steps_Data_Modeling.cs` Step 6, replace the placeholder `pk` string with the composite of `customerId` and `today`:

```csharp
var pk = $"{customerId}#{today}";
```

The step seeds the same 100 orders on today's date and runs `SELECT DISTINCT VALUE c.partitionKey FROM c` — this time the container holds **~50** distinct partition-key values (one per customer for today).

## Step 7: Distribution summary (Prebuilt)

The step prints the contrast directly: `OrdersHot` ended up with 1 partition-key value, `OrdersComposite` with ~50. At a small scale like 100 docs Cosmos won't have split into multiple physical partitions, so the portal heat map won't show a dramatic split — but the **logical** partition distribution is shown in the results of the distinct-value query measures.

If you want to see what this looks like at production scale, open **Azure Portal > Cosmos DB > Monitoring > Insights > Throughput > Normalized RU Consumption (Max) Heat Map By PartitionKeyRangeId**. Above ~10k RU/s with multiple physical partitions, the hot container spikes one PartitionKeyRangeId while the composite stays flat.

## Lab Complete!

You compared a normalized vs denormalized model on the same domain, observed the read-cost difference (Step 2 vs Step 1) and the write-cost difference (Step 3), demonstrated the query patterns the embed model was actually designed around (Step 4), and finished with the classic hot-partition vs composite-key visualization (Steps 5–7).

**Key takeaways**:
- Reads in a normalized model fan out across many containers; embedding collapses that to one point read.
- Denormalization moves cost from reads to writes — updates to shared data need to fan out, typically via change feed.
- Design the model around the hot query paths the app actually runs.
- Small datasets don't need partitioning — a single fixed `partitionKey` value keeps queries simple and lets you point-read by `id`.
- For high-volume workloads, a composite partition key (e.g. `customerId#orderDate`) spreads load and avoids hot partitions.
